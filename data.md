Core Vision
NexusDeFi aims to be a Thirdweb- or Alchemy-like platform for DeFi, enabling developers to build cross-chain payment DApps with minimal friction. It abstracts EVM and SVM complexities using custom smart contracts, provides a unified smart wallet with diverse authentication (phone, Google, email, ENS, social logins), and offers a flexible paymaster model where developers can choose to sponsor user fees. The SDK, built for TypeScript, Node.js, and Next.js, simplifies integration, while a custom cross-chain indexer ensures transactions are visible on both EVM and SVM block explorers under a single wallet address or correlated TX hash. The infrastructure is designed for extensibility, making it easy to add new EVM and SVM chains without external dependencies.

Key Features
Unified Smart Wallet:
A single smart wallet operates across EVM and SVM, built using custom ERC-4337 smart contracts for EVM and a PDA-based equivalent for SVM.
Authentication via Web3Auth or a custom OAuth-based solution, mapping phone numbers, Google, email, ENS, and social logins (e.g., Twitter, Discord) to a single wallet address.
Wallet address is consistent across chains, achieved through a deterministic deployment mechanism (e.g., CREATE2 for EVM, PDA derivation for SVM).
Transactions are traceable on EVM (e.g., Etherscan) and SVM (e.g., Solscan) explorers, with a custom indexer correlating TX hashes and wallet metadata.
Custom Cross-Chain Transaction System:
A bespoke transaction router handles EVM and SVM transactions without external frameworks like Neon EVM or Tria’s BestPath AVS.
For EVM: Transactions use JSON-RPC and custom ERC-4337 contracts for account abstraction.
For SVM: Transactions use Solana’s transaction format with a custom PDA-based abstraction layer.
Cross-chain payments are facilitated by a lightweight bridge contract (deployed on both EVM and SVM) that locks assets on one chain and mints equivalents on the other, with a custom indexer ensuring unified TX visibility.
Flexible Paymaster Model:
A custom paymaster contract for EVM and a fee-sponsoring program for SVM allow developers to decide whether to sponsor user fees or pass them to users.
Developers can configure fee policies (e.g., “sponsor fees for first 100 transactions” or “users pay in USDC”) via the SDK.
Supports fee payments in ERC-20 (EVM) or SPL (SVM) tokens, with a fallback to native tokens (ETH, SOL) if needed.
Paymaster integrates with the unified smart wallet, ensuring gasless or token-based fees across chains.
Extensible Chain Support:
A modular chain registry (stored as JSON in the backend) allows developers to add new EVM chains (e.g., Polygon, Arbitrum) and SVM chains (e.g., Solana Mainnet) by specifying RPC endpoints and token standards.
The transaction router dynamically adapts to new chains using chain-specific adapters (e.g., EVMAdapter, SVMAdapter) that handle chain-specific logic (e.g., gas estimation for EVM, lamport calculation for SVM).
No reliance on external frameworks ensures full control and customization.
TypeScript SDK (Node.js and Next.js):
A developer-friendly SDK built in TypeScript, with first-class support for Node.js and Next.js.
Exposes APIs for payments, wallet management, and DeFi primitives (e.g., token transfers, batch payments).
Includes React components for Next.js (e.g., <PaymentButton>, <WalletConnect>) to simplify frontend integration.
Presets for common DeFi tasks (e.g., recurring payments, cross-chain transfers) reduce boilerplate code.
Hosted on npm with comprehensive documentation and examples.
Cross-Chain Transaction Visibility:
A custom indexer (built into the backend) correlates EVM and SVM transactions, mapping them to a single wallet address or TX hash.
Example: A payment from Polygon to Solana generates a TX hash (e.g., 0x123... on Etherscan, abc... on Solscan), with metadata linking both via a unified explorer API.
Developers can query transaction status across chains using the SDK.
User Onboarding:
Seamless authentication via Web3Auth or a custom OAuth system, mapping diverse identifiers (phone, email, Google, ENS, social logins) to the unified smart wallet.
CEX-like UX with a simplified mode for casual users and an advanced mode for developers/traders.
Supports cross-chain naming (e.g., ENS on EVM, .sol domains on SVM) for user-friendly addressing.
Developer Pain Points Addressed
Cross-Chain Development Complexity:
Problem: Developers juggle Solidity for EVM and Rust for SVM, dealing with different account models, transaction formats, and fee structures.
Solution: Custom ERC-4337 contracts for EVM and PDA-based contracts for SVM provide a unified interface. The SDK abstracts chain-specific logic, letting developers write chain-agnostic code (e.g., sendPayment).
Wallet Management:
Problem: Managing EOAs (EVM) and keypairs (SVM) is complex, and seed phrases deter mainstream users.
Solution: The unified smart wallet uses custom ERC-4337 and PDA contracts, with social logins mapped to a single address. Users interact via phone, email, or social accounts, eliminating seed phrases.
Fee Management Flexibility:
Problem: Developers struggle to implement gasless flows or flexible fee models across chains.
Solution: The custom paymaster allows developers to sponsor fees (fully, partially, or not at all) or let users pay in tokens. Configurable policies (e.g., “sponsor fees for transactions under $5”) simplify UX.
Transaction Tracking Across Chains:
Problem: EVM and SVM explorers don’t correlate cross-chain transactions, making it hard to track payments.
Solution: A custom indexer maps transactions to a single wallet address or TX hash, providing unified visibility on EVM and SVM explorers.
Adding New Chains:
Problem: Supporting new EVM or SVM chains requires significant code changes.
Solution: The chain registry and adapter-based architecture allow developers to add chains by updating a JSON config, with the SDK handling chain-specific logic.
User Onboarding Barriers:
Problem: Crypto wallets are intimidating for non-technical users due to complex key management.
Solution: Social logins and a unified smart wallet simplify onboarding, with a CEX-like UX appealing to mainstream users.
DeFi Integration Complexity:
Problem: Building DeFi DApps requires integrating complex protocols (e.g., Uniswap, Serum) across chains.
Solution: The SDK includes pre-built modules for common DeFi tasks, abstracting protocol interactions and reducing developer effort.
Infrastructure Design (Extending NexusPay-App)
The NexusPay-App backend (from the GitHub repo) handles user authentication, wallet management, and payment processing. NexusDeFi extends this with a custom-built, cross-chain infrastructure:

Unified Smart Wallet:
EVM: Deploy custom ERC-4337 contracts (EntryPoint, WalletFactory, Paymaster) in Solidity, handling account abstraction and gasless transactions.
SVM: Deploy a custom PDA-based program in Rust, mimicking ERC-4337 functionality for Solana (e.g., program-initiated transactions).
Authentication: Extend NexusPay’s backend to map user identifiers (phone, Google, email, ENS, social logins) to the wallet address using Web3Auth or a custom OAuth system.
Deployment: Use CREATE2 (EVM) and PDA derivation (SVM) for deterministic wallet addresses across chains.
Custom Paymaster:
EVM: A Solidity-based paymaster contract sponsors gas fees or accepts ERC-20 tokens, configurable via SDK settings.
SVM: A Rust-based program handles fee sponsorship or token-based payments (SPL tokens).
Policy Engine: A backend service (extending NexusPay’s API) lets developers define fee policies (e.g., “sponsor fees for new users”).
Integration: Paymaster works with the unified smart wallet, ensuring seamless fee handling.
Cross-Chain Transaction Router:
A backend service (built on NexusPay’s Node.js/Express framework) routes transactions to EVM or SVM based on the target chain.
EVM transactions use ethers.js for JSON-RPC calls; SVM transactions use @solana/web3.js for Solana’s format.
A lightweight bridge contract (Solidity for EVM, Rust for SVM) handles cross-chain asset transfers by locking/minting tokens, avoiding external frameworks.
Cross-Chain Indexer:
Extend NexusPay’s backend database (e.g., MongoDB/PostgreSQL) to store transaction metadata (TX hashes, wallet addresses, chain IDs).
A custom indexer monitors EVM and SVM chains, correlating transactions to a single wallet address or TX hash.
Expose an API (e.g., /tx/:hash) for developers to query cross-chain transaction status, with metadata displayed on EVM/SVM explorers.
TypeScript SDK (Node.js and Next.js):
Built in TypeScript, with modules for payments, wallet management, and DeFi primitives.
Includes React components for Next.js (e.g., <PaymentButton>, <WalletBalance>).
Chain adapters (EVMAdapter, SVMAdapter) handle chain-specific logic, configured via a JSON-based chain registry.
Example API:
sendPayment({ from, to, amount, token, chain: 'auto' }): Initiates a cross-chain payment.
getBalance(address, token): Queries balance across EVM/SVM.
configurePaymaster({ sponsorFees: true, token: 'USDC' }): Sets fee sponsorship rules.
Chain Registry:
A JSON-based registry (stored in the backend) lists supported chains (RPCs, token standards, chain IDs).
Developers add new chains by updating the registry (e.g., { chainId: 137, rpc: 'https://polygon-rpc.com', type: 'evm' }).
The SDK dynamically loads chain configs, ensuring extensibility.
Backend Enhancements:
Extend NexusPay’s REST/GraphQL API to support cross-chain operations (e.g., /wallet/create, /tx/send).
Use JWT or OAuth for secure API access, with encryption for user data (e.g., phone-to-wallet mappings).
Scale the backend with a load balancer and Redis for caching, handling high transaction volumes.
Visionary Elements
Developer Empowerment:
The SDK’s TypeScript-first approach, with Node.js and Next.js support, aligns with modern web development workflows, reducing the learning curve.
Pre-built DeFi modules (e.g., for cross-chain payments, batch transactions) let developers focus on app logic, not chain specifics.
Mainstream Accessibility:
Social logins and a unified smart wallet make DeFi accessible to non-crypto users, with a UX rivaling centralized apps.
Cross-chain naming (ENS, .sol domains) simplifies addressing, enhancing user trust.
Flexible Fee Models:
The paymaster’s configurability lets developers tailor fee strategies to their DApp’s needs (e.g., sponsor fees to attract users, then shift to user-paid for profitability).
Token-based fees (USDC, etc.) align with DeFi’s token economy, avoiding native token complexity.
Unified Transaction Visibility:
The custom indexer creates a seamless cross-chain experience, making transactions traceable across explorers without external dependencies.
A developer dashboard (built on Next.js) visualizes transaction flows, boosting transparency.
Extensibility and Control:
Custom contracts and a chain registry give developers full control, avoiding reliance on third-party frameworks.
Easy chain addition ensures NexusDeFi adapts to new EVM L2s or SVM variants.
